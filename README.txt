This plugin uses artificial intelligence to provide image customization for your WooCommerce products. Customers can create personalized image designs by topic or freehand, and developers can create a unique shopping process. [Take a look here](https://artist-image-generator.com/product/woo-product-ai-image-customizer-to-sell-personalized-products/).

In the background, it uses Artist Image Generator shortcodes to create independent, topic-based image generators for each of your products.

You can add your custom AIG shortcodes to create independent, topic-based image generators for each of your products. The customer visits the product page, generates an AI image from a prompt and/or topic, and buys the product. You can view the personalized image on the admin order page. Additionally, you can control how many images a user can generate and set a refresh time if desired.

You can also generate a live basic preview of the personalized product using a mask image. The mask can be created through AIG or using external tools.
