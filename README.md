Once you are on the plugin's "Settings" tab, you'll have all the instructions to create an OpenAI API key:

- Sign up / Log in to the OpenAI developer portal: [https://openai.com/api/](https://openai.com/api/)

- Copy and paste the new secret key into the **OPENAI_API_KEY** field.
- Press "Save changes," and **you are ready to use the plugin**.

## How it Works

The extension utilizes the API of OpenAI (ChatGPT) and leverages their cutting-edge artificial intelligence service, [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) | [DALL·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3/).

DALL·E 2 / 3 enables you to [generate images from text input](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/). Additionally, it provides the capability to generate variations of images from a .png file.
